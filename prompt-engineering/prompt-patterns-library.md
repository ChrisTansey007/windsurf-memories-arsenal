- **Source Thread:** [To be added]

---

### 3. Evaluation Patterns
*Prompts that request self-assessment or quality checks*

#### Pattern: Self-Scoring
```
"Score your draft for clarity, specificity, and constraint adherence (1-5 scale)."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 4/5
- **Use When:** Need quality assurance before finalization
- **Why It Works:** Triggers AI self-review mechanism
- **Source Thread:** agents.md structure (2025-10-20)

#### Pattern: Quality Gate Checklist
```
"Before finalizing, verify: {CHECKLIST}. If any item fails, revise."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 5/5
- **Use When:** Critical outputs requiring validation
- **Why It Works:** Systematic check prevents common errors
- **Source Thread:** [To be added]

---

### 4. Refinement Patterns
*Prompts that improve or transform existing content*

#### Pattern: Template Extraction
```
"Condense the prior response into a standardized reusable template."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 5/5
- **Use When:** Want to reuse successful approaches
- **Why It Works:** Transforms specific into general
- **Source Thread:** agents.md structure (2025-10-20)

#### Pattern: Upgrade Request
```
"Refactor prior answer to include external citations and examples from real projects."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 5/5
- **Use When:** Need to elevate quality of existing output
- **Why It Works:** Builds on existing work rather than starting over
- **Source Thread:** agents.md structure (2025-10-20)

---

### 5. Verification Patterns
*Prompts that ensure accuracy and completeness*

#### Pattern: Citation Addition
```
"Add 2 verifiable citations or repository links supporting each section."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 5/5
- **Use When:** Need factual grounding
- **Why It Works:** Makes claims verifiable and credible
- **Source Thread:** agents.md structure (2025-10-20)

#### Pattern: Assumption Declaration
```
"List all assumptions you're making. If any are uncertain, ask for clarification."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 4/5
- **Use When:** Complex problems with ambiguity
- **Why It Works:** Surfaces hidden assumptions
- **Source Thread:** [To be added]

---

### 6. Comparison Patterns
*Prompts that request analysis of alternatives*

#### Pattern: Contrast Request
```
"Explain how this {ARTIFACT} differs from or complements a {RELATED_ARTIFACT}."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 4/5
- **Use When:** Need to understand relationships between artifacts
- **Why It Works:** Clarifies positioning and prevents confusion
- **Source Thread:** agents.md structure (2025-10-20)

#### Pattern: Alternative Proposal
```
"Propose 2-3 alternative approaches with pros/cons for each."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 5/5
- **Use When:** Want to explore options before committing
- **Why It Works:** Prevents tunnel vision
- **Source Thread:** [To be added]

## üìä Effectiveness Rating System

**5/5** - Consistently produces excellent results, highly reusable  
**4/5** - Very effective, minor variations needed for some contexts  
**3/5** - Generally useful, may need significant adaptation  
**2/5** - Works occasionally, context-dependent  
**1/5** - Rarely effective, needs major rework

**Ratings based on:**
- Clarity impact
- Specificity gain
- Reusability across domains
- Consistency of results

---

## üîÑ Pattern Evolution

**As we analyze more threads:**
- ‚úÖ Patterns get refined based on performance
- ‚úÖ Effectiveness ratings validated across multiple uses
- ‚úÖ Patterns combined into compound patterns
- ‚úÖ Domain-specific variations documented
- ‚úÖ Frequency tracking (how often pattern appears)

---

## üå± Contributing New Patterns

**When you find an effective prompt:**

1. **Identify the category** (clarify, constrain, evaluate, refine, verify, compare)
2. **Extract the template** (replace specifics with {{VARIABLES}})
3. **Document effectiveness** (initial rating + evidence)
4. **Note source thread** (for traceability)
5. **Add to appropriate section** above

**Format:**
```markdown
#### Pattern: {NAME}
```
"{pattern template with {{VARIABLES}}}"
```
- **Effectiveness:** {1-5}/5
- **Use When:** {scenarios}
- **Why It Works:** {mechanism}
- **Source Thread:** {thread-id} ({date})
```

---

## üìà Pattern Validation

**When pattern appears in multiple threads:**
- Update effectiveness rating if higher performance observed
- Add cross-references to all source threads
- Note any variations that work better in specific domains
- Consider promoting to "Proven Pattern" (3+ validations)

**Example:**
```markdown
#### Pattern: Citation Requirement ‚≠ê PROVEN (3 threads)
```
"Include 2-3 real-world examples or citations validating this approach."
```
- **Effectiveness:** 5/5 (validated across 3 threads)
- **Use When:** Need credibility and external validation
- **Why It Works:** Grounds AI output in verifiable sources
- **Source Threads:** 
  - agents.md (2025-10-20)
  - email-oauth-debug (2025-10-19)
  - api-design (2025-10-18)
```
